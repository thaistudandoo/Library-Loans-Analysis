# Analysis of Loaned Collections from UFRN Libraries
This is a project for #7DaysOfCode, where we will explore the loaned collections data from the UFRN library system. The main objective is to understand the quantity of loans over the past 10 years and gain insights into the libraries, most borrowed themes, and other relevant aspects.

# Problem Description
The primary goal of a library is to ensure that informational materials are being utilized. Loans can serve as a basic indicator of usage, although it cannot guarantee actual reading or utilization of borrowed materials.

To improve the infrastructure, resources, and processes of the UFRN libraries, it is essential to comprehend the current scenario through an analysis of loaned data. Some critical questions that can be answered include:

* Is the quantity of loans increasing or decreasing over the last few years?
* Which libraries within the system have the highest loan numbers?
* What are the most borrowed themes? And the least borrowed?
These insights will provide valuable information to the library's management team, aiding in decision-making to enhance the infrastructure, resources, and processes of the information units.

# Data Collection and Organization
The data used in this project was collected from the loaned collections of UFRN libraries and the collection specimens. You can import this data directly into your Jupyter Notebook by using the "Raw" link address on Github as the source.
